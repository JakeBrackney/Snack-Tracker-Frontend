# Snack Tracker 


## Description
Have you ever been to a restaurant you loved but there was one item you'd go back for all by itself? Snack Tracker is an app where users can keep track of their favorite and most memorable item on the menu from various restaurants they've visited. Anyone can comment on a snack post and share their ideas about it. This repo contains the front end of the application.

## Functionality
Users are able to see a list of their restaurants, are able to see details about a single restaurant, are able to comment on each restaurant, and are able to delete a restaurant.
 

## Technologies Used
The application as a whole is built using a MERN stack. The front end views are rendered using React. We tied the front end and back end using Cors and deployed the front end to Surge.


## Installed dependencies 

- Mongoose
- Express
- React 
- Node

## Future App Improvements

- Fix the delete issue. Users may delete a restaurant, but will have to press the back button and refresh the   Restaurant List page in the browser before seeing that a restaurant has been deleted. Delete technically       works, but the rendering/redirecting is buggy.
- Better Design
- Enable users to create new snack posts from the browser
- Utilize the Google Maps API to display the location of each restaurant on each individual restaurant's show   page.
